I think I spend 20% of my workday actually solving problems and 80% of it waiting for permission to solve problems, because I don't know what I'm allowed to do. I want an Official Responsibility Flowchart. I want an authoritative document to describe whose job is whose so I can spend more time solving problems and less time waiting. 

And I'm positive there are disagreements about it! That's fine! Let's debate it in a version control system. Let's make it legit.

I take pride in my work! I want to work! I don't want to play responsibility hot potato until it's time to go home! Let's iron this out! 

Github is the perfect place for this debate. Documents uploaded here can be copied but not altered without the owner's approval. This respects individual opinions and makes sure people's opinions aren't written over. Most important it is incredibly time efficient, because spin-offs don't require people to write the whole thing from scratch, only the parts they want to edit.
